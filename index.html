                            I studied philosophy at UVSC/UVU (during the transition years). I found myself floundering when it came to the 
                            continental tradition, but excelled at formal logic and discrete mathematics. On my instructors' suggestions, I 
                            dipped my toes into computer science with a couple classes in C#, but that was as far as I went at the time.

                            I had been driving a cab to make ends meet in college. It was a rough industry, even before Uber put it on 
                            life support, but it opened the door for me into hospice care. The past 5 years I've gotten fulfillment 
                            from bringing drugs to elderly patients, but fulfillment isn't the same as direction. In that time I've 
                            driven 400-thousand miles without ever leaving the state; it strikes me as an apt metaphor.

                            I didn't realize it at the time, but my first programming experience came from creating an RPG in the 
                            Warcraft 3 level editor as a teen. I was preoccupied with seeing myself as "creative," and "subverting" the 
                            intended format of the game let me think of it as an art project. Nevertheless I spent about a month creating 
                            events and scripts and animations just to put my brother through a single hellish playthrough where he got to 
                            see the delightful punishments I'd lined up for him for using cheat codes. In hindsight, if I'd put more 
                            thought into it then, I might have come up with programming as a career path sooner, but like I said, I didn't
                             think of what I was doing as programming. I thought programming just meant 1's and 0's.
